# dotnet-heroku-test
Testing the viability of deploying a dotnet app on Heroku.

This application is a straight out of the box, DotNet Core Razor Pages app. No database, no business logic, nothing. Just the ol' command 
`dotnet new webapp` followed by a GitHub push to master. Then Heroku kicks in and builds it! Simple as that.

[Preview the app running on Heroku](https://jonnowdotnettest.herokuapp.com/).

This is the start of big, new things.
